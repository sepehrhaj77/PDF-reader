        <p><b>Description of Project:</b> This program take a text document (can not be a word document or anything else) and sorts all of the different words into a binary search tree. It then displays the words in order of most reoccurring in a table. The purpose of this is to highlight key words in a document that the user might need to pay attention to as it is most likely an important topic in that section of text. However, a large amount of very common, insignificant words such as "and, was, too, etc." have not been included as those are not very helpful in distinguishing important concepts. </p>
        <p>For your convenience, you can click the words in the table to get a new tab that defines the word for you from dictionary.com!</p>
